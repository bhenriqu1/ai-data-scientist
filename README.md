AI Data Scientist

The AI Data Scientist is an autononmous ML agent. 

End-to-end ML pipeline orchestrated by LLMs to automate data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and optimization. 
The system dynamically generates and refines code to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and datetime expansion, 
while supporting multiple algorithms (Logistic/Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, kNN, MLP).

Key Impact: Delivered a fully autonomous ML workflow capable of iteratively improving models toward >85% accuracy benchmarks, 
reducing manual intervention in feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
